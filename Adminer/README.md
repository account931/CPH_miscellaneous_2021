## Adminer 
- <p> Database management in a single PHP file. </p>
- <p>Replace phpMyAdmin with Adminer and you will get a tidier user interface, better support for MySQL features, higher performance and more security. </p>

## How to use:
- <p> Upload root file adminer-4.8.1.php to anywhere and run it. Requires DB passwors, so u can't use it if your localhost SQL DB does not use password, i.e user: root, password: ''</p>
- <p> If you want to test Adminer on localhost whithout password, use /Adminer_without_SQL_password/adminer-start-file.php. NB: Yoo have to put some tempo password in Line 9 there and use it for log in </p>
